## Build and Run

Read [build](BUILD.md) document if you want to understand how typing_meter works or want to debug an issue and run it locally.


## Pull Requests

- All pull requests must have an issue linked with it. Please create an issue if it doesn't exist already before creating a pull request.
- Creating an issue beforehand helps discuss bugs and enhancements before work begins, preventing wasted effort.
- Comment on an issue if you are willing to work on it if no one else is assigned already.

1. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).

2. Single feature or bug-fix per PR.

3. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Do not end the title with full-stop
- Limit the title to 72 characters or less
- Leave one line empty after your title if the message has a body
- Refer issues like "This fixes bug #ID" at the end of the body

### Python Styleguide

All python code is linted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) by running `black .`
- Place imports in the following order:
  - Built-in Python Modules (such as `os`)
  - typing_meter Modules (using relative paths)
- Format imports using [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) by running `isort --profile black .`
- Avoid platform-dependent code

### Pre-commit

You can run the above styling checks manually, however we encourage you to use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) instead.
Install pre-commit and set up the hooks by running the following commands.
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
Now during a commit, all the checks will run on the modified files.

You can run pre-commit against all the files without committing by running -
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Code of Conduct

While contributing to the project, it is very important to maintain a healthy environment! Hence we request you to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
